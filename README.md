#To deploy your Flask application using Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins, you need to follow several steps to set up the application and configure the deployment pipeline. Here are the detailed steps to deploy your Flask app:

Step 1: Prepare Your Flask Application
Ensure Your Flask App Is Ready: Ensure that your Flask application (app.py) and any dependencies are prepared. Make sure the application is running as expected locally.

Organize Your Project Files: Ensure your project files are well-organized, including the Flask application, the requirements file, and any other supporting files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Step 2: Set Up a Dockerfile
Create a Dockerfile: In the root directory of your project, create a Dockerfile to specify how your application should be containerized.

Define the Base Image: Use the python:3.10-slim base image for your Dockerfile.

Set the Working Directory: Use the WORKDIR /app command to set the working directory inside the container.

Copy the requirements: Copy the requirements.txt file into the container and install dependencies using the RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt command.

Copy the Application Code: Use the COPY . . command to copy all project files into the container.

Expose the Flask App Port: Use the EXPOSE 5926 command to expose the Flask app port.

Set the Entry Point: Use CMD ["python", "app.py"] as the entry point to run the Flask application when the container starts.

Step 3: Build and Push the Docker Image
Build the Docker Image: Use the docker build -t satvikjangra/dockertry:latest . command to build the Docker image.

Push the Docker Image: Use the docker push satvikjangra/dockertry:latest command to push the image to Docker Hub.

Step 4: Set Up Kubernetes Configuration Files
Create Deployment.yaml: In your project directory, create a Deployment.yaml file to specify the deployment configuration.

Create Service.yaml: Create a Service.yaml file to specify how the application should be exposed.

Step 5: Deploy the Application Using Kubernetes
Apply the Deployment Configuration: Use the kubectl apply -f Deployment.yaml command to deploy the application using Kubernetes.

Apply the Service Configuration: Use the kubectl apply -f Service.yaml command to set up the service.

Step 6: Set Up Jenkins Pipeline
Create a Jenkinsfile: In the root directory of your project, create a Jenkinsfile to define your CI/CD pipeline.

Define Pipeline Stages: Specify the stages for cloning the repository, building the Docker image, pushing the image to Docker Hub, and deploying the application using Kubernetes.

Configure Jenkins: Ensure Jenkins is set up and connected to your repository.

Trigger the Pipeline: Run the Jenkins pipeline to build, push, and deploy your application.
